#### Can't you see my hands are clean?
#### I'm as holy as can be
#### I will never do you harm
#### I am fractured
#### It can never be the same
&nbsp;
#### Can't you see my hands are clean?
#### Can't you see?
#### I'm as holy as can be
&nbsp;
#### What kind of life is this?
#### (What kind of life is this?)
#### What kind of life is this?
#### (What kind of life is this?)
&nbsp;
#### Can't you see my hands are clean?
#### I'm as holy as can be
#### I will never do you harm again
#### I am fractured
#### It can never be the same
&nbsp;
#### What kind of life is this?
#### (What kind of life is this?)
#### What kind of life is this?
#### (What kind of life is this?)
&nbsp;
#### I warned you a thousand times
#### It's like crying to the clouds
&nbsp;
#### And why are you asking me questions
#### You already know the answer to?
&nbsp;
#### Can't you see my hands are clean?

#### What kind of life is this?
#### (What kind of life is this?)
#### What kind of life is this?
#### (What kind of life is this?)
&nbsp;
#### A good life
&nbsp;
#### What kind of life is this?
#### (What kind of life is this?)
&nbsp;
#### A good life
&nbsp;
#### What kind of life is this?
#### (What kind of life is this?)
&nbsp;
#### A good life
#### Is a quiet life
#### A good life
#### Is a quiet life
