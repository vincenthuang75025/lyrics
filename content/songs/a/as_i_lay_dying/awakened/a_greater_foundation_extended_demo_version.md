#### Reality no longer battles perception.
#### This letter's written to no one.
&nbsp;
#### Sincere,
#### I sought your truth and divine purpose
#### through myths of revelation.
#### Guidance all wrapped up in a paper box,
#### supported only so long
#### as my mind was the enemy.
#### I could not in conscience hold on.
&nbsp;
#### As we face distress
#### we must not lose heart.
#### Stand fast and press on,
#### Triumph awaits.
#### As we face distress
#### we must not lose heart.
#### Stand fast and press on,
#### Triumph awaits us.
&nbsp;
#### The powerful constant that I had once leaned on is no longer there.
#### (No longer)
#### You call this shameful disbelief,
#### a process like losing my closest friend.
&nbsp;
#### As we face distress
#### we must not lose heart.
#### Stand fast and press on,
#### Triumph awaits.
#### As we face distress
#### we must not lose heart.
#### Stand fast and press on,
#### Triumph awaits us.

#### Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart,
#### Before we can rebuild them again,
#### A Greater Foundation.
#### We watch our whole lives.
#### Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives
####   fall apart,
#### Before we can rebuild them again,(rebuild them again)
#### A Greater Foundation.
&nbsp;
#### I wish there was another way,
#### but no amount of devotion can fix this.
&nbsp;
#### Triumph awaits.
#### Triumph awaits.
#### Triumph awaits.
#### Triumph awaits.
#### Triumph awaits.

#### Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart,
#### Before we can rebuild them again,
#### A Greater Foundation.
#### We watch our whole lives.
#### Fall apart.
#### Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives.
#### Rebuild them again.
#### Before we can rebuild them again,
#### A Greater Foundation
