#### Take a photograph, it'll be the last
#### Not a dollar or a crowd could ever keep me here
#### I don't have a past, I just have a chance
#### Not a family or honest plea remains to say
&nbsp;
#### Rain, rain, go away
#### Come again another day
#### All the world is waiting for the sun
&nbsp;
#### Is it you I want or just the notion of
#### A heart to wrap around so I can find my way around?
#### Safe to say from here, you're getting closer now
#### We are never sad, 'cause we are not allowed to be
&nbsp;
#### Rain, rain, go away
#### Come again another day
#### All the world is waiting for the sun
&nbsp;
#### Rain, rain, go away
#### Come again another day
#### All the world is waiting for the sun
&nbsp;
#### To lie here, under you, is all that I could ever do
#### To lie here, under you, is all
#### To lie here, under you, is all that I could ever do
#### To lie here, under you, is all
&nbsp;
#### Rain, rain, go away
#### Come again another day
#### All the world is waiting for the sun
&nbsp;
#### Rain, rain, go away
#### Come again another day
#### All the world is waiting for the sun
&nbsp;
#### All the world is waiting for the sun
#### All the world is waiting for the sun
