#### It was late one summer evening
#### when I saw that butterfly
#### On its wings were every colour
#### you could find
&nbsp;
#### And I held it for a moment
#### then I let if fly away
#### Soon it disappeared
#### and left me far behind
&nbsp;
#### And in my imagination
#### I was floating on the breeze
#### Drifting over every mountain,
#### sea and land
&nbsp;
#### And with no one there to stop me
#### Every dream was coming true
#### People walking side by side,
#### and hand in hand
&nbsp;
#### Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
#### Spread your wings, like a bird, flying high
#### Set your sail, ride the wind
#### take the news around the world
#### Bringing love and happiness eternally
&nbsp;
#### Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
#### Fly away, like a star in the sky
#### Carry hope, carry faith
#### into every lonely heart
#### Teach the world to live in peace and harmony
&nbsp;
#### In a dream I saw it flying
#### to a far and distant shore
#### Where the people stood
#### and watched it with a smile
&nbsp;
#### Soon the quarreling was over
#### There was peace throughout the land
#### Making all the days of traveling
#### seem worthwhile
&nbsp;
#### There were tulip fields in Holland
#### And the roses in Versailles
#### And the English country garden
#### in the sun
&nbsp;
#### Edelweiss and bright red poppies
#### Lovely blue forget-me-nots
#### Growing tall and proud,
#### and shared by everyone
&nbsp;
#### Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
#### Spread your wings, like a bird, flying high
#### Set your sail, ride the wind
#### take the news around the world
#### Bringing love and happiness eternally
&nbsp;
#### Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
#### Fly away, like a star in the sky
#### Carry hope, carry faith
#### into every lonely heart
#### Teach the world to live in peace and harmony
&nbsp;
#### Now and then there is danger all around
#### Thunder strikes and lightning hits the ground
#### But my friend shakes his wings and carries on
#### Through the rain to the sun
&nbsp;
#### Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
#### Spread your wings, like a bird, flying high
#### Set your sail, ride the wind
#### take the news around the world
#### Bringing love and happiness eternally
&nbsp;
#### Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
#### Fly away, like a star in the sky
#### Carry hope, carry faith
#### into every lonely heart
#### Teach the world to live in peace and harmony
&nbsp;
#### And I wish that I could be up
#### there with you
#### and fly so free in the sky, butterfly  butterfly
