#### I remember when how we used to play
#### How we let our dreams take us far away
#### And when evening came and all the lights were turned down low
#### They told us tales of long ago
&nbsp;
#### Where have all my heroes gone?
#### Cinderella and Peter Pan
#### All the stories of fairyland
#### Have they come to an end?
&nbsp;
#### Where have all my heroes gone?
#### Good ol' Kermit and Superman
#### Were a part of my wonderland
#### And we'll always be friends
&nbsp;
#### Childhood days are gone every now and then
#### I look back and wish they were here again
#### Growing up is fun although it hurts to realize
#### We sometimes leave those friends behind
&nbsp;
#### Where have all my heroes gone?
#### Cinderella and Peter Pan
#### All the stories of fairyland
#### Have they come to an end?
&nbsp;
#### Where have all my heroes gone?
#### Good ol' Kermit and Superman
#### Were a part of my wonderland
#### And we'll always be friends
&nbsp;
#### Where have all my heroes gone
#### Precious friends that were dear to me
#### From the kingdom of fantasy
#### They just faded away
&nbsp;
#### Where have all my heroes gone
#### Cinderella and Peter Pan
#### All the stories of fairyland
#### Have they come to an end?
&nbsp;
#### Good ol' Kermit and Superman
#### Were a part of my wonderland
#### And we'll always be friends
#### And we'll always be friends
#### And we'll always be friends
&nbsp;
#### Where have all my heroes gone?
#### Where have all my heroes gone?
