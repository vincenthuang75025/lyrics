#### (Finders keepers, losers weepers)
&nbsp;
#### Welcome to the end of eras
#### Ice has melted back to life
#### Done my time and served my sentence
#### Dress me up and watch me die
&nbsp;
#### If it feels good, tastes good
#### It must be mine
#### Dynasty decapitated
#### You just might see a ghost tonight
&nbsp;
#### And if you don't know now you know
&nbsp;
#### I'm taking back the crown
#### I'm all dressed up and naked
#### I see what's mine and take it
#### (Finders keepers, losers weepers)
#### Oh yeah
&nbsp;
#### The crown
#### So close I can taste it
#### I see what's mine and take it
#### (Finders keepers, losers weepers)
#### Oh yeah
&nbsp;
#### Sycophants on velvet sofas
#### Lavish mansions, vintage wine
#### I am so much more than royal
#### Snatch your chain and mace your eyes
&nbsp;
#### If it feels good, tastes good
#### It must be mine
#### Heroes always get remembered
#### But you know legends never die
&nbsp;
#### And if you don't know now you know
&nbsp;
#### I'm taking back the crown
#### I'm all dressed up and naked
#### I see what's mine and take it
#### (Finders keepers, losers weepers)
#### Oh yeah
&nbsp;
#### The crown
#### So close I can taste it
#### I see what's mine and take it
#### (Finders keepers, losers weepers)
#### Oh yeah
&nbsp;
#### Mortal kings are ruling castles
#### Welcome to my world of fun
#### Liars settle into sockets
#### Flip the switch and watch them run
&nbsp;
#### Oh yeah
#### (Finders keepers, losers weepers)
&nbsp;
#### I'm taking back, back, taking back, back the crown
#### I'm all dressed up and naked
#### I see what's mine and take it
#### (Finders keepers, losers weepers)
#### Oh yeah
&nbsp;
#### The crown
#### So close I can taste it
#### I see what's mine and take it
#### (Finders keepers, losers weepers)
#### Oh yeah
