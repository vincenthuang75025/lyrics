#### Ohh!
#### A moment you'll never remember
#### And a night you'll never forget!
#### Ohh!
&nbsp;
#### All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
#### Show praise with your body
#### Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
#### And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
#### Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
#### Say your prayers
#### Say your prayers
#### Say your prayers
#### (Hallelujah!)
&nbsp;
#### My life started the day I got caught
#### Under the covers
#### With secondhand lovers
#### Oh, tied up in pretty young things
#### In a state of emergency
#### Who was I trying to be
&nbsp;
#### Then the time for being sad is over
#### And you miss them like you miss no other
#### And being blue is better than being over it (over it)
&nbsp;
#### All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
#### Show praise with your body
#### Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
#### And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
#### Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
#### Say your prayers
#### Say your prayers
#### Say your prayers
#### (Hallelujah!)
&nbsp;
#### I was drunk and it didn't mean a thing
#### Stop thinking about
#### The bullets from my mouth
#### I love the things you hate about yourself
#### Just finished a daydream
#### Who were you trying to be
&nbsp;
#### Then the time for being sad is over
#### And you miss them like you miss no other
#### And being blue is better than being over it (over it)
&nbsp;
#### No one wants you when you have no heart and
#### I'm sitting pretty in my brand new scars and
#### You'll never know if you don't ever try again
#### So let's try
#### Let's try
#### Let's try
&nbsp;
#### All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
#### Show praise with your body
#### Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
#### And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
#### Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
#### Say your prayers
#### Say your prayers
#### Say your prayers
#### (Hallelujah!)

#### All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)

#### Stand up, sing hallelujah (hallelujah!)
#### And if you can't stop shaking, lean back
#### Let it move right through ya (hallelujah!)
#### Say your prayers
#### Say your prayers
#### Say your prayers
