#### You want someone to blame
#### The one who drives the rusted nail
#### But who's left will never care
#### Pretending becomes a chore
#### All you search for, a little piece of mind
#### Too far, too deep, the two faced smile
#### So lost, you feel, I know
&nbsp;
#### Wide awake but still asleep
#### Always a stranger in a crowd (Sleep, sleep, sleep)
#### Wide awake, always a stranger in a crowd (Wake, wake, wake)
&nbsp;
#### Just this once
#### Listen to the words I say
#### If you want I will
#### I'm there until the end of time
&nbsp;
#### Leave the doomed behind
#### Search with different light
#### You were trying to remember
#### But it's all make believe
&nbsp;
#### You are, you are, you are
&nbsp;
#### Wide awake but still asleep (Wide awake but still asleep)
#### Always a stranger in a crowd
&nbsp;
#### Just this once
#### Listen to the words I say
#### If you want I will
#### I'm there until the end of time
&nbsp;
#### Just this once
#### Listen to the words I say
#### If you want, I'm there
&nbsp;
#### Just this once
#### Listen to the words I say
#### If you want I will
#### I'm there until the end of time
