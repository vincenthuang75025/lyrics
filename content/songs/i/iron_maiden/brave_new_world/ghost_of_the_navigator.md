#### Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
#### But I know, I know
&nbsp;
#### I see the ghosts of navigators but they're lost
#### As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
#### As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
#### The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me
&nbsp;
#### Take my heart and set it free
#### Carried forward by the waves
#### Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
#### Chasing rainbows all my days
&nbsp;
#### Where I go I do not know
#### I only know the place I've been
#### Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
#### Nothing's real until you feel
