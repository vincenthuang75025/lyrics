#### Light reflects from your shadow
#### It is more than I thought could exist
#### You move through the room
#### Like breathing was easy
#### If someone believed me
&nbsp;
#### They would be as in love with you as I am
#### They would be as in love with you as I am
#### They would be as in love with you as I am
#### They would be in love, love, love
&nbsp;
#### And everyday
#### I am learning about you
#### The things that no one else sees
#### And the end comes too soon
#### Like dreaming of angels
&nbsp;
#### And leaving without them
&nbsp;
#### And leaving without them
&nbsp;
#### Being as in love with you as I am
#### Being as in love with you as I am
#### Being as in love with you as I am
#### Being as in love, love, love
#### Love, love, love
#### Love, love, love
&nbsp;
#### And with words unspoken
#### A silent devotion
#### I know you know what I mean
&nbsp;
#### And the end is unknown
#### But I think I'm ready
#### As long as you're with me
&nbsp;
#### Being as in love with you as I am
#### Being as in love with you as I am
#### Being as in love with you as I am
#### Being as in love, love, love
