#### I'll be coming home just to be alone
#### 'Cause I know you're not there and I know that you don't care
#### I can hardly wait to leave this place
&nbsp;
#### No matter how hard I try you're never satisfied
#### This is not a home, I think I'm better off alone
#### You always disappear even when you're here
#### This is not my home, I think I'm better off alone
&nbsp;
#### Home, home, this house is not a
#### Home, home, this house is not a home
&nbsp;
#### By the time you come home I'm already stoned
#### You turn off the TV and you scream at me
#### I can hardly wait till you get off my case
&nbsp;
#### No matter how hard I try you're never satisfied
#### This is not a home, I think I'm better off alone
#### You always disappear even when you're here
#### This is not my home, I think I'm better off alone
&nbsp;
#### Home, home, this house is not a
#### Home, home, this house is not a
#### Home, home, this house is not a
#### Home, home, this house is not a home
&nbsp;
#### I'm better off alone
&nbsp;
#### No matter how hard I try you're never satisfied
#### This is not a home, I think I'm better off alone

#### This is not my home, I think I'm better off alone

#### Home, home, this house is not a
#### Home, home, this house is not a
#### Home, home, this house is not a
#### Home, home, this house is not a home
