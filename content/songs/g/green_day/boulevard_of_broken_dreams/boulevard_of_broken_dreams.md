#### I walk a lonely road
#### The only one that I have ever known
#### Don't know where it goes
#### But it's home to me and I walk alone
&nbsp;
#### I walk this empty street
#### On the Boulevard Of Broken Dreams
#### When the city sleeps
#### And I'm the only one and I walk alone
&nbsp;
#### I walk alone
#### I walk alone
#### I walk alone
#### I walk a-
&nbsp;
#### My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
#### My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
#### Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
#### Till then I walk alone
&nbsp;
#### Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
#### Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
&nbsp;
#### I'm walking down the line
#### That divides me somewhere in my mind
#### On the borderline
#### Of the edge and where I walk alone
&nbsp;
#### Read between the lines
#### What's fucked up and everything's alright
#### Check my vital signs
#### To know I'm still alive and I walk alone
&nbsp;
#### I walk alone
#### I walk alone
#### I walk alone
#### I walk a-
&nbsp;
#### My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
#### My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
#### Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
#### Till then I walk alone
&nbsp;
#### Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
#### Ah-ah, ah-ah
&nbsp;
#### I walk alone
#### I walk a-
&nbsp;
#### I walk this empty street
#### On the Boulevard Of Broken Dreams
#### When the city sleeps
#### And I'm the only one and I walk a-
&nbsp;
#### My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
#### My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
#### Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
#### Till then I walk alone
