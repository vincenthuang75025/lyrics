&nbsp;
#### Undo these chains, my friend
#### I'll show you the rage I've hidden
#### Perish the sacrament
#### Swallow, but nothing's forgiven
&nbsp;
#### You and I can't decide
#### Which of us was taken for granted
#### Make amends, some of us
#### Are destined to be outlived
&nbsp;
#### Step inside; see the Devil in I
#### Too many times we've let it come to this
#### Step inside; see the Devil in I
#### You'll realize I'm not your devil anymore
&nbsp;
#### Under the words of men
#### Something is tempting the father
#### Where is your will, my friend?
#### Instantiates never even bother
&nbsp;
#### You and I, wrong or right
#### Traded a lie for the leverage
#### In between the lens in light
#### You're not what you seem
&nbsp;
#### Step inside; see the Devil in I
#### Too many times we've let it come to this
#### Step inside; see the Devil in I
#### You'll realize I'm not your devil
&nbsp;
#### I'm not your devil anymore
&nbsp;
#### Your station is abandoned
#### Fooled you, 'cause I know what you've done
#### Sensation, deprivation
#### You should've burned when you turned on everyone
&nbsp;
#### So step inside; see the Devil in I
#### Too many times we've let it come to this
#### Step inside; see the Devil in I
#### I know you'll find your answers in the end
#### Step inside; see the Devil in I
#### You'll realize I'm not your devil (Anymore)
&nbsp;
#### So step inside, step inside
#### See the Devil in I, see the Devil in I
