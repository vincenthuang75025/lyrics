#### Black gold, black gold
#### Our soul's been sold (sold)
#### It drips down our throats
#### Fills up our lungs
#### We can barely breathe
#### Can't spread our wings
&nbsp;
#### Golden horizon
#### Burst in flames
#### Burning despair
#### Again and again
#### Golden horizon
#### So bright, but it's fading
#### Burst in flames
#### Eternal return
#### We're waiting and waiting
#### Again and again and again
&nbsp;
#### We know
#### But we'll never change
#### It's true
#### That's what we became
#### We're standing on the edge
#### We'll never change
#### We'll never change
&nbsp;
#### We know
#### But we'll never change
#### It's true
#### That's what we became
#### We're standing on the edge
#### We'll never change
#### We'll never change
#### Edge of black
#### Edge of black
&nbsp;
#### Like a king with a rusty crown
#### Like a saint on its way down
#### To the deepest ocean floor
#### Forevermore!
&nbsp;
#### Black gold, black gold (gold)
#### Our soul's been sold (sold)
#### We all know the truth
#### But we'll never change
#### A shadow of a saint
#### That's what we became

&nbsp;
#### The destroying angel shall arise
#### To give salvation to a world of lies
#### We will drown in an ocean of black
#### And we all deserve it
#### No way back!
