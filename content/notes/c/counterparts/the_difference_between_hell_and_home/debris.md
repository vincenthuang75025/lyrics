#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|Everything ends, at least that's what we hope for.]]
#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|Plagued by our past and we're doomed to repeat ourselves.]]
#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|Afraid of the thoughts that dance in revolutions, and circle the mind like a snare: Binding me, I'm just trying to feel something.]]
#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|Cold and stale, searching for warmth inside of every promise wasted.]]
#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|You wrap yourself around me, but I can only sense your presence.]]
#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|You're nothing but a carcass.]]
#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|I've never felt more alone than I did on those nights I spent watching you sleep.]]
#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|You're the furthest thing from me, and you've been there from the start.]]
#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|An empty shell, you're vacant and it scares me to death. One by one, I watched them leave me behind like living debris.]]
#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|Fortunately, I know that I'm not worth it.]]
#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|Because in my purest form, I was never good enough for anyone.]]
#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|Why did I think that this time it'd be different?]]
#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|I came bearing only the beat of my heart and the best of my intentions.]]
#### [[notes/z/zero_7/simple_things/in_the_waiting_line.md#and-ill-shout-and-ill-scream|I tried by hardest but I couldn't make you feel a fucking thing.]]
