&nbsp;
#### You got two black eyes from loving too hard
#### And a black car that matches your blackest soul
#### I would change ya, oh
#### Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no-oh
&nbsp;
#### Oh the neon coast was your sign
#### And the Midwest wind with Pisces rising
#### Wouldn't change ya, oh
#### Wouldn't ever try to make you leave, no-oh
&nbsp;
#### Static palms melt your vibe
#### Midnight whisperings
&nbsp;
#### The black magic on Mulholland Drive
#### Swimming pools under desert skies
#### Drinking white wine in the blushing light
#### Just another LA Devotee
&nbsp;
#### Sunsets on the evil eye
#### Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
#### Always on the hunt for a little more time
#### Just another LA Devotee
&nbsp;
#### Just another, just another, uh-oh
#### Just another, just another, uh-oh
#### Just another, just another, uh-oh
#### Just another LA Devotee
&nbsp;
#### You got bleached out eyes from the valley sand
#### And the black tar palms keep weeping your name
#### I couldn't change ya, oh-oh
#### Couldn't ever try to make you see, oh-oh
&nbsp;
#### The high rise lights read your rights
#### And a downtown storm with Aries rising
#### Couldn't change you, oh-oh
#### Couldn't ever try to make you leave, no-oh
&nbsp;
#### Static palms melt your vibe
#### Midnight whisperings
&nbsp;
#### The black magic on Mulholland Drive
#### Swimming pools under desert skies
#### Drinking white wine in the blushing light
#### Just another LA Devotee
&nbsp;
#### Sunsets on the evil eye
#### Invisible to the Hollywood shrine
#### Always on the hunt for a little more time
#### Just another LA Devotee
&nbsp;
#### Just another, just another, uh-oh
#### Just another, just another, uh-oh
#### Just another, just another, uh-oh
#### Just another LA Devotee
&nbsp;
#### (LA Devotee)
#### (LA Devotee)
#### (LA Devotee)
#### (LA Devotee)
