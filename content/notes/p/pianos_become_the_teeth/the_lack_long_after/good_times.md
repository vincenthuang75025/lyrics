#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|You're laying here with a beds eye view of a body that no longer belongs to you,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|You're scared that the past 3 haven't lived past their 60's and if you break the trend,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|You'll just end up like the old folks at Roland and 3939,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|You're scared because you're an army brat of a man who died before his time.]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|I miss those summers, that grill smell, home cooked meals, take me back,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|Sleeping like a log, healing so fast,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|But losing you, I learned to lose my youth, lose my spirit, and now I can't hear it anymore,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|And I guess that's life]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|Back then our body parts stayed in place,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|We kept up with our own hearts,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|It was so easy to temper the sting,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|Just be fixed by a quick dip back in some old neighbor's swimming pool]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|Now I'm just worn out, and I'll ache like this forever I think,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|These shoddy drapes refuse to keep the cold out]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|And this damn body can't keep the warmth in,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|I'm watching my hairline recede, I'm drinking fatigue, I'm fighting heredity]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|I see less of who I love the most, time's getting away,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|And we're so slow to say how fast it goes,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|I'm just looking for what's coming, what's built in the blood]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|But I've never been that sure of anything anyway]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|And I don't want to heal, I'm just about the perfect amount to look how I feel]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|And I think about you laying there, waiting for her to get back,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|I think about your last 3 breaths and I wonder if you knew,]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|I think about letting you go]]
#### [[notes/b/bloodhound_gang/hefty_fine/ralph_wiggum.md#im-going-to-africa|And I guess that's life.]]
