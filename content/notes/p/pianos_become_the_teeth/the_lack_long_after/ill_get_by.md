#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|I used to listen to my life,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|I was so put together,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|I chose what I wanted to be in that age of chasing sand,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|The age of believing in everything,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|But I couldn't save you,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|I couldn't save what was taken away,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|And I'm still singing, and you still can't stay.]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|You "loved life," and those words have lasted,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|I just wish I would have had ears for more than what you said]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|Because I still feel the lack long after.]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|Such a light body, such a quiet gait leaving behind the weight of the world,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|I'll always think it was too early to lose your shine,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|I guess the means that ends us means nothing,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|I just hope it's the peace we all need,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|Because I could love and drown in your God damned smile lines,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|But I think I burnt up watching you rallying to stay alive,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|And I guess that's fine.]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|It seems we all get sick,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|We all die in some no name hospital with the same colored walls,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|And I guess that's fine,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|But I want to swallow, I want to stomach, I want to live.]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|It's been a rough while and some days are worse than others,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|There's no proper way to feel, no mirth, no levity, no amazing grace,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|Just a flame on a lake floating away,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|I can't let you lay,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|I want you to know, I'm learning patience against my will,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|I want you to know, I'll get by, always barely scraping]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|With just a hunger, with just a heart apart,]]
#### [[notes/b/bryan_adams/reckless/run_to_you.md#oh-im-gonna-run-to-you|It's a hell of a thing.]]
