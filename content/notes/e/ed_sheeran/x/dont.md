#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|I met this girl late last year]]
#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|She said "Don't you worry if I disappear"]]
#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|I told her "I'm not really looking for another mistake"]]
#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait]]
#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|But then I jumped right in a week later, returned]]
#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn]]
#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|But I gave her my time for two or three nights]]
#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|Then I put it on pause until the moment was right]]
#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|I went away four months until our paths crossed again]]
#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|She told me "I was never looking for a friend]]
#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|Maybe you could swing by my room around ten]]
#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin]]
#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"]]
#### [[notes/t/type_o_negative/bloody_kisses/black_no_1_little_miss_scareall.md#little-wolfskin-boots|Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing]]

#### [[notes/b/boy_harsher/lesser_man_extended_version/lust.md#take-the-girl-take-her-with-you|That heart is so cold]]
#### [[notes/b/boy_harsher/lesser_man_extended_version/lust.md#take-the-girl-take-her-with-you|All over my arm]]
#### [[notes/b/boy_harsher/lesser_man_extended_version/lust.md#take-the-girl-take-her-with-you|I don't wanna know that, babe]]

#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|For a couple weeks I only wanna see her]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|Before a text message was the only way to reach her]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|But me and her, we make money the same way]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|Four cities, two planes, the same day]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|And those shows have never been what it's about]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about]]
#### [[notes/l/la_dispute/wildlife/the_most_beautiful_bitter_fruit.md#after-sundown-before-sleeping|She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing]]

#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|I don't even know if she knows what for]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|Trust and respect is what we do this for]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|I never intended to be next]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|And I never saw him as a threat]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|It's not like we were both on tour]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|This is not the way you realized what you wanted]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest]]
#### [[notes/m/metallica/master_of_puppets/master_of_puppets.md#needlework-the-way-never-you-betray|All this time, God knows I'm singing]]
