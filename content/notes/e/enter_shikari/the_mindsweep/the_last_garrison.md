#### Can you hear the war-cry?
&nbsp;
#### The adrenaline bursts through the riverbanks
#### Welcome to the skirmish
#### I can't feel my legs
#### Give me morphine
#### Give me morphine
#### Give me more!
&nbsp;
#### No doubt
#### This is a tragedy for all
#### But it ain't over yet
#### Head's up and thank fuck you're still alive!
&nbsp;
#### There's still air in my lungs
#### Still blood in my veins
#### We're part of the last garrison
#### Still Alive
#### There's still air in my lungs
#### Still blood in my veins
#### We're part of the last garrison
&nbsp;
#### I wanna lie here and soak up the sun
#### But do not alight here, you cannot outrun
#### "This could be the end" he said, "the end my child"
#### So I made good use of my face and I smiled
&nbsp;
#### Can you hear the war-cry?
&nbsp;
#### The epinephrine plows through the barriers
#### Welcome to the skirmish
#### I can't feel my legs
#### Give me opium
#### Give me opium
#### Give me hope!
&nbsp;
#### No doubt
#### This is a tragedy for all
#### But it ain't over yet
#### Head's up and thank fuck you're still alive!
&nbsp;
#### There's still air in my lungs
#### Still blood in my veins
#### We're part of the last garrison
#### Still Alive
#### There's still air in my lungs
#### Still blood in my veins
#### We're part of the last garrison
&nbsp;
#### I wanna lie here and soak up the sun

&nbsp;
#### Let's toast to the fact we got this far
&nbsp;
#### The adrenaline bursts through the riverbanks
