#### For the rise of my distrust
#### Please forgive me
#### For the rise of my distrust
#### Please forgive me
&nbsp;
#### But by and by it destroys my inner force
#### The first thing in my head when I wake up
#### Save my heart
#### You are the last thing in my head when I fall in sleep
#### You could destroy it
#### All I want is just the truth to trust
#### All I want is trust
#### My heart dies by suffering
&nbsp;
#### [[notes/hard_wired.md#you-catch-me-when-i-fall|Im afraid to fall again]]
&nbsp;
#### I look into your eyes
#### And try to see behind the walls
#### The walls of silence
&nbsp;
#### My heart in your hands
#### I hate the past
#### You could destroy it
#### But all I need is the truth
#### Is just the truth
#### You could break me into pieces with one fuckin’ lie
&nbsp;
#### Save my heart
&nbsp;
#### It’s like the kiss of death
&nbsp;
#### I kissed the death
#### My heart in your hands / it could break again
#### So save my fuckin’ heart
&nbsp;
#### Your words are like paste
#### I can’t see their real shape.
