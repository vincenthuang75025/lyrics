#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|I do dimly perceive that while everything around me is ever-changing, ever-dying there is, underlying all that change, a living power that is changeless, that holds all together, that creates, dissolves, and recreates.]]
#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|That informing power or spirit is God, and since nothing else that I see merely through the senses can or will persist, He alone is.]]
#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|And is this power benevolent or malevolent?]]
#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|I see it as purely benevolent.]]
#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|For I can see, that in the midst of death, Life persists, in the midst of untruth, Truth persists, in the midst of darkness, Light persists.]]

#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|He is the supreme good.]]
#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|But He is no god who merely satisfies the intellect, if He ever does.]]
#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|God to be God must rule the heart and transform it.]]
#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|He must express Himself in every smallest act of His votary.]]
#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|It is proved not by extraneous evidence, but in the transformed conduct and character of those who have felt the real presence of God within.]]
#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|To reject this evidence is to deny oneself.]]
#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|This realization is preceded by an immovable faith.]]
#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|He who would, in his own person, test the fact of God's presence can do so by a living faith, and since faith itself cannot be proved by extraneous evidence, the safest course is to believe in...; the law of Truth and Love.]]
#### [[notes/f/faith_no_more/the_real_thing/falling_to_pieces.md#because-im-somewhere-in-between|Exercise of faith will be the safest where there is a clear determination summarily to reject all that is contrary to Truth and Love.]]
