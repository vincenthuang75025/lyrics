## Hosting on GitHub Pages
Quartz is designed to be effortless to deploy. If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.

### Enable GitHub Actions
By default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!

### Enable GitHub Pages

Head to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.

1. (IMPORTANT) Set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`
2. Set a custom domain here if you have one!

For the rise of my distrust
Please forgive me
For the rise of my distrust
Please forgive me

But by and by it destroys my inner force
The first thing in my head when I wake up
Save my heart
You are the last thing in my head when I fall in sleep
You could destroy it
All I want is just the truth to trust
All I want is trust
My heart dies by suffering

I’m afraid to fall again

I look into your eyes
And try to see behind the walls
The walls of silence

My heart in your hands
I hate the past
You could destroy it
But all I need is the truth
Is just the truth
You could break me into pieces with one fuckin’ lie

Save my heart

It’s like the kiss of death

I kissed the death
My heart in your hands / it could break again
So save my fuckin’ heart

Your words are like paste
I can’t see their real shape.
