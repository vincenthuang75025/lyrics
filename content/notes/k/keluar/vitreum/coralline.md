#### This salt-sick rest is over,
#### lay crushed on the rusted stones.
#### The sand has all been swallowed,
#### it's wrapped in the undertow.
&nbsp;
#### The bay is only shallow enough to repeat
#### this game of wound and follow
#### to the edge of the sea.
&nbsp;
#### Colour me insane, I'll take you where
#### the coast divides the sorrow.
#### This is my terrain,
#### I'll take you there to show you
#### on what the suffering depends.

#### Bellicose spray
#### cuts right through me,
#### birds fall half-dead,
#### clouds are rolling
#### into the shore.
#### I saw it all.
