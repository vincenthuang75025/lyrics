#### [[notes/g/godhead/evolver/deconstruct.md#im-taking-the-words-youve-said|(Hello? Are you there? Listening? I'm just trying to get in touch man. I've been so fucking, so fucking down lately. Like, I don't know what's happening. I'm just so tired all the time. Trying to sleep. I just, I just lay there quiet. Can't speak cause everyone around me is passed out. My fucking mind's raging. Uh, hello? I don't even know why I called. I think it, I think it might be time for me to leave. Just call it quits. I'm sick of this. It's the same fucking day, every day. I think I sleep, I can't be sure though. It's all the same now. Drink, drink, drink again. I'm tired man. I think it, you don't want to hear this. I'm a mess. I'm sorry man. I just don't know who to turn to. No one really hears me, you know? I speak, at least I think I speak, but no one hears me. I've said enough. Hello? Hello? I shouldn't have called.)]]
