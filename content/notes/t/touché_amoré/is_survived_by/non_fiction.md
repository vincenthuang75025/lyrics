#### Every moment can't remain
#### And every life won't stay the same
#### With time comes a layer of rust
#### And our bones will turn to dust
#### Everyone will fall away
#### And every season is built on change
#### With time, the paint will peel
#### And all sense will lose its feel
#### Every cloth will start to fray
#### And every night will become day
#### With time, a mold will form
#### And what's cold can become warm
#### Every love can't always stay
#### And the dead will soon decay
#### With time, we'll all be gone
#### But how you lived can live on
