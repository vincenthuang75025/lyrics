breathing was easy If someone believed me  They would be as in love with you as I am They would be as in love with you as I am They would be as in love with you as I am They would be in love, love, love  And everyday I am learning about you The things that no one else sees And the end comes too soon Like dreaming of angels  And leaving without them  And leaving without them  Being as in love with you as I am Being as in love with you as I am Being as in love with you as I am Being as in love, love, love Love, love, love Love, love, love  And with words unspoken A silent devotion I know you know what I mean  And the end is unknown But I think I&amp;rsquo;m ready As long as you&amp;rsquo;re with me  Being as in love with you as I am Being as in love with you as I am Being as in love with you as I am Being as in love, love, love</description></item><item><title>Chained</title><link>https://lyrics.vvhuang.com/songs/t/the_xx/coexist/chained/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00
