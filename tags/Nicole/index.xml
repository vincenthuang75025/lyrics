colour you could find  And I held it for a moment then I let if fly away Soon it disappeared and left me far behind  And in my imagination I was floating on the breeze Drifting over every mountain, sea and land  And with no one there to stop me Every dream was coming true People walking side by side, and hand in hand  Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly Spread your wings, like a bird, flying high Set your sail, ride the wind take the news around the world Bringing love and happiness eternally  Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly Fly away, like a star in the sky Carry hope, carry faith into every lonely heart Teach the world to live in peace and harmony  In a dream I saw it flying to a far and distant shore Where the people stood and watched it with a smile  Soon the quarreling was over There was peace throughout the land Making all the days of traveling seem worthwhile  There were tulip fields in Holland And the roses in Versailles And the English country garden in the sun  Edelweiss and bright red poppies Lovely blue forget-me-nots Growing tall and proud, and shared by everyone  Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly Spread your wings, like a bird, flying high Set your sail, ride the wind take the news around the world Bringing love and happiness eternally  Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly Fly away, like a star in the sky Carry hope, carry faith into every lonely heart Teach the world to live in peace and harmony  Now and then there is danger all around Thunder strikes and lightning hits the ground But my friend shakes his wings and carries on Through the rain to the sun  Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly Spread your wings, like a bird, flying high Set your sail, ride the wind take the news around the world Bringing love and happiness eternally  Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly Fly away, like a star in the sky Carry hope, carry faith into every lonely heart Teach the world to live in peace and harmony  And I wish that I could be up there with you and fly so free in the sky, butterfly butterfly</description></item><item><title>Don’t Fly Too High</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/songs/n/nicole/dont_fly_too_high/dont_fly_too_high/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan
