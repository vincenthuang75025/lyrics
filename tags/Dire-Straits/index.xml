Then he makes it fast with one more thing &amp;ldquo;We are the Sultans, we are the Sultans of Swing&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>Sultans of Swing</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/songs/d/dire_straits/a_history_of_rock_vol_1/sultans_of_swing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/songs/d/dire_straits/a_history_of_rock_vol_1/sultans_of_swing/</guid><description>[[songs/o/opeth/watershed/the_lotus_eater.md#the-weakness-of-the-psyche-vyl-wnanory|You get a shiver in the dark]] [[songs/o/opeth/watershed/the_lotus_eater.md#the-weakness-of-the-psyche-vyl-wnanory|It&amp;rsquo;s raining in the park but meantime]] [[songs/o/opeth/watershed/the_lotus_eater.md#the-weakness-of-the-psyche-vyl-wnanory|South of the river you stop and you hold everything]] [[songs/o/opeth/watershed/the_lotus_eater.</description></item><item><title>Walk Of Life</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/songs/d/dire_straits/the_best_of_dire_straits__mark_knopfler__private_investigations/walk_of_life/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/songs/d/dire_straits/the_best_of_dire_straits__mark_knopfler__private_investigations/walk_of_life/</guid><description>[[songs/d/damageplan/new_found_power/wake_up.md#pure-adrenaline-i-tear-in-vyl-wnanory|Here come Johnny singing oldies, goldies]] [[songs/d/damageplan/new_found_power/wake_up.md#pure-adrenaline-i-tear-in-vyl-wnanory|Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say]] [[songs/d/damageplan/new_found_power/wake_up.md#pure-adrenaline-i-tear-in-vyl-wnanory|Here come Johnny singing I Gotta Woman]] [[songs/d/damageplan/new_found_power/wake_up.md#pure-adrenaline-i-tear-in-vyl-wnanory|Down in the tunnel trying to make it pay]] [[songs/d/damageplan/new_found_power/wake_up.</description></item></channel></rss>
